- I learned how to write unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests using pytest framework
- I learned how to write API documentation using Swagger 

## Key technologies covered

The following are the key technologies covered during the program:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for backend development.

- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD feature of GitHub that allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository.
- **Swagger**: A tool for documenting APIs and generating interactive API documentation.
- **pytest**: A testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases.

## Important backend development concepts

The following are the important backend development concepts covered during the program:

- **API Design Principles**: Best practices for designing APIs that are easy to use, understand, and maintain.
- **Database Design**: Principles and practices for designing efficient and scalable database schemas.
- **Caching Strategies**: Techniques for improving application performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
- **Message Queues**: A method for communication between services that allows for asynchronous processing of tasks.
- **Containerization**: The practice of packaging applications and their dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Practices for automating the integration and deployment of code changes.
- **Scalability**: Techniques for designing applications that can handle increased load by adding resources.

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Methods for writing code that can perform multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main execution thread.
- **Context Management**: Using context managers in Python to manage resources efficiently.
- **Decorator Pattern**: A design pattern in Python that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- **Generator Functions**: A special type of function in Python that returns an iterator and allows for lazy evaluation of sequences.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: A deployment strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments.

## Challenges faced and solutions implemented

During the program, I faced several challenges, including:

- **Understanding Asynchronous Programming**: Initially, I found it challenging to grasp the concepts of asynchronous programming and how to implement it effectively in Python. To overcome this, I dedicated extra time to studying asynchronous programming concepts and practiced by building small projects that utilized async features.
- **Dockerizing Applications**: I struggled with containerizing applications using Docker, especially when dealing with complex dependencies. I resolved this by following official Docker documentation and experimenting with different configurations until I achieved a working setup.
- **Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines**: Configuring CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions was initially overwhelming. I tackled this by breaking down the process into smaller steps and seeking help from online communities and tutorials.
- **Database Optimization**: I encountered performance issues with database queries. To address this, I learned about indexing, query optimization techniques, and used tools like EXPLAIN ANALYZE to analyze query performance.
- **Testing Complex Scenarios**: Writing tests for complex scenarios was challenging. I improved my testing skills by studying best practices, using pytest features, and writing tests for various edge cases.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploying applications on Kubernetes was a steep learning curve. I overcame this by following step-by-step tutorials, experimenting with different configurations, and utilizing online resources to understand Kubernetes concepts better.
- **Message Broker Configuration**: Setting up and configuring message brokers like RabbitMQ and Redis was initially confusing. I resolved this by referring to official documentation and community forums for troubleshooting tips.
